# Obsolete!

This folder contains a quick experiment to compare results of
YAKE! and KP-Miner on the KP20k dataset.

Results indicate that the two have very different predictions,
although neither is really satisfactory.
Also in relation to [pke #185](https://github.com/boudinfl/pke/issues/185),
where I was wondering about the original removal of KP-Miner from pke.
